      title: 'Enabling Robust Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Improved Ant Colony Algorithm'
      subtitle: 'Prof. Sidi Lu, William & Mary | Oct 2023 – Present'
      text: |
        Developed an enhanced pheromone update strategy for the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. Introduced **top-K pheromone update strategies** to reinforce the best solutions and maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to a non-linear accumulation of pheromones on superior paths. Avoided premature convergence on sub-optimal solutions by limiting significant updates to the top-performing paths. Applied the algorithm to complex optimization problems like the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, improving both efficiency and performance.

      title: 'Application of Hypercube Queuing Model to Healthcare Management Research'
      subtitle: 'Prof. Daniela Hurtado Lange, Northwestern University | Sep 2023 – Present'
      text: |
        Adapted the **Hypercube Queuing Model** for healthcare resource allocation, originally developed for urban emergency services. Developed advanced algorithms for optimizing healthcare system operations, focusing on vehicle location and response district design. Enhanced decision-making processes in healthcare management to ensure efficient distribution of medical resources.
