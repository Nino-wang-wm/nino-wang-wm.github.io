My name is Jiufan Wang, and my preferred name is Nino. I am currently a Ph.D. student in Industrial and Systems Engineering at The Ohio State University, pursuing the Operations Research track.

I received my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from the School of Aeronautical Engineering at the Civil Aviation University of China, and my master's degree in Computational Operations Research from the Department of Mathematics at William & Mary.

During my master's studies, I collaborated with Professor Sidi Lu from the Department of Computer Science at William & Mary on research related to vehicle path planning, and also worked with Professor Daniela Hurtado Lange from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University on the application of stochastic models in healthcare systems.

My current research interests focus on large-scale optimization, nonlinear optimization, and the application of optimization techniques in machine learning.

By the way, I'm also glad to share a different side of my experience. After graduating with my bachelor's degree in 2021, I spent nearly a year working as a bass guitarist in a nightclub in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. I am deeply grateful for that experience—it gave me a unique perspective on life and helped me appreciate creativity and diversity beyond academia.
